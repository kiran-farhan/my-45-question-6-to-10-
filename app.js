Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
var personname = "\n\t kiran_farhan \n\t";
console.log(personname);

// let myname: string= 'kiran_farhan';
// let date: number= 15/3/2024 
console.log("my name is kiran_farhan");
// name : ayesha
// date: 15-3-2024
console.log("5-3");
